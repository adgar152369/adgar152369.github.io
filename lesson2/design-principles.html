            <p id="wiki">Wikipedia has its design constantly throughout every page you go through. It's aim is for content, and not design, which makes it more repetitive than anything else. </p>

        <div id="box-2"><h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

            <p class="info">I chose Bleacher Report because it utilizes white space very well. It is very consistent throughout the entire app, to display scores, articles, players, etc. It creates an organized display while having a significant amount of information one page.</p>

            <p class="info">Apple's website is very simple, in that it appeals to all demographics. The big pictures, the big and short text is very easy to read, and is straight to the point. It has a header, body and footer; very basic.</p>
