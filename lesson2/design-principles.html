        <h1>Fitt's Law</h1>
        <p>The bigger an object and the closer it is, the easier it is to use.</p>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a></h3>

        <p>The Bleacher Report website is a good example of Fitt's Law.<br></p>
        <p>When you first load the site, the first, and most prominent feature of the site is what's most exciting in the sports world, giving the user access to the most important sports news. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="column-2">
        <h1>Hick's Law</h1>
        <p>With every additional choice increases the time required to take a decision. The more options a user has on your website, the more difficult it is to use.</p>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tacobell.com">Taco Bell</a></h3>
        <img src="/lesson2/images/tacobell-scrnsht.png" alt="taco bell website">
        <p>There are many options when a user loads into the Taco Bell website.</p><br>
        <p>First, the main ad draws the user in about winning a contest. There are side bar options to the left, and finally, there are food favorites the user can choose. With so many options to click on, this makes decision-making a little more difficult for the user.</p>

        <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
        <p>Certain parts of a website will be more important than others, and will be more prominent.</p>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://news.google.com/topstories?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en">Google News</a></h3>
        <img src="/lesson2/images/googlenews-scrnsht.png" alt="">
        <p>Google News lays out their website where the main articles are bigger and in the "main" section of the website; thus, making it more important than the ads that are off to the side.</p><br>
